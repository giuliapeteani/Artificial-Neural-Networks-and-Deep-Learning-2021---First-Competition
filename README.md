# Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-2021---First-Competition


Competition rules defined by prof. Boracchi G. and Matteucci M.: 

"In this homework you are required to classify images of leafs (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the
species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label."
